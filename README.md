EscapingTitanic

About the Project
This is our first group project consisting of a mini escape game. The goal is to build a text based escape game which is interactive and fun to play.
A group of four students was given about two weeks to complete a given basis of the game and to enhance and expand it.

Methodology
The game is developed entirely in Python, utilizing fundamental concepts. Players make choices and navigate through the game by responding to prompts and challenges presented in the console.

Project Structure
This project is built in a jupyter notebook but can easily be converted into a .py file to enhance gameplay.

Improvements on the game:
The storyline was adjusted to the titanic, a mini game was added, some visual enhancements were made.

Conclusion
The knowledge learnt in the first three weeks of the bootcamp helped us understanding the given code and enhancing it. 

Enjoy playing the game!
